## My process

### Built with

- Parcel
- BEM
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use BEM and how to give names to html elements.
Parcel - i love it. It's very cool pice of technology, help me a lot with scss compiling and serving html.
This is my first time to work with new version SCSS, in beginning confusing but after a while it's very clean to me how to use it.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on BEM and try use it with React components.
Definitely more focus on pixel perfect design.
Nice preparation  for next bigger project with this project setup.
